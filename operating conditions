The project operates primarily in an AUTONOMOUS MODE;
Following a loop of detection, movement, and application. 
The flow chart for the machine is detailed below:

1. Initialization and Setup (ON State)
The system, powered by the Li-ion battery, is switched ON.
The Bluetooth module (HC-05) is connected to the control mobile app (e.g., 'Series Bluetooth Terminal'), giving the operator manual control authority.
The Arduino UNO initializes the BO Motors, Servo Motor, and sensors.

2. Plant Detection (Sensing Phase)
The robot starts moving forward, searching for plants.
The ESP32-CAM continuously captures images of the environment.
The on-board Edge Impulse ML model processes the captured image data to confirm the presence of a target plant.

Result: If a plant is detected, a signal is sent to the Arduino.

3. Movement and Proximity Check (Navigation Phase)
Upon receiving the plant detection signal, the Arduino commands the DC Motors (via the motor driver) to move the robot forward.
The Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) continuously measures the distance between the robot and the detected object (the plant).

Result: The Arduino monitors the distance. 
        When the robot reaches a predefined distance (proximity threshold) from the plant, the system moves to the next stage.

4. Targeted Fertilizer Dropping (Application Phase)
The Arduino commands the robot to stop the DC motors.
The Servo Motor is activated, which opens the dispenser channel.
A pre-measured amount of fertilizer is dropped onto the targeted plant.
The Servo Motor then closes the dispenser channel.

5. Cycle Restart
The robot begins moving forward again, returning to the Plant Detection phase to search for the next target plant.

MANUAL CONTROL (Override Mode);
In addition to the autonomous mode, the operator can use the Bluetooth module (HC-05) and a mobile app to send commands to the Arduino to manually control the robot's direction.
This provides flexibility for navigation in situations where the autonomous system might not perform optimally.
